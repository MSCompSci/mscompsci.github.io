# 'Workout Wizard' Fitness App

## Summary

In this project, I collaborated with four other students to design a fitness app to encourage users to meet their fitness goals and learn about healthy habits. We designed two versions of this app, one with a standard fitness theme, and the other with a fantasy theme. To support our design, we performed user interviews, card sorts and generated user personas. We then created a low-fidelity prototype, sought user feedback, and then created a high-fidelity prototype incorporating this feedback. We then used A/B testing via the Maze research platform to compare user preferences and error rates between the two versions of the high-fidelity prototype.
