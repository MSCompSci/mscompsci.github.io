# Workout Wizard: A Gamified and A/B Tested Fitness App

## Summary

In this project, I collaborated with four other students to design a fitness app to encourage users to meet their fitness goals and learn about healthy habits. The app gamifies fitness by allowing users to increase the level of their character by logging workouts and answering knowledge quizzes based on various articles. 

We designed two versions of this app, one with a standard fitness theme, and the other with a fantasy theme. We performed multiple rounds of user research to determine user preferences and refine our designs. Finally, we compared the two versions using A/B testing via the Maze research platform, and discovered that users had an equal preference between the themes.

## Project Scope

The purpose of this project was to create an application of our choosing and then support our design decisions using a variety of UX research methods. We were responsible for creating a project concept based on background research and initial user feedback, creating and refining a wireframe design, and then creating a higher-fidelity interactive prototype and conducting usability testing and an analysis of collected data.

## Initial Research

To form the basis of our design, we examined a variety of academic articles on the impacts of fitness apps on user health journeys and attitudes. We also examined common elements in existing fitness and wellness applications to uncover common themes. We interviewed a set of participants to discover their preferences and existing attitudes towards fitness and wellness, and we conducted a card sort to determine what elements they believed to be the most important in their fitness journeys. We also asked them to perform a set of usability tasks on these apps, such as creating an account and logging in, to determine opportunities for our app to improve upon the user experience of these apps.

## Analysis and User Personas

We compiled the results of this research into an affinity diagram to group our discoveries into different opportunities for improvement and uncover user sentiments and preferences. We then used this information to prioritize the features we should include in our design and generate a set of five user personas to represent our target users.

## Wireframe Design

After this analysis, we designed a set of wireframes. We created user flows where users can login and/or create an account, monitor their character's stats, log workouts, and read articles to boost their knowledge.

## Design Refinement

We then refined our design without external user input by completing a cognitive walkthrough of the design followed by a heuristic evaluation following Don Norman's 7 design principles. Our analysis discovered room for improvement in providing feedback and context to users on the login screen and during the process of logging a workout. We also recognized at this stage that some elements did not look clickable with the existing color contrast, and that this should be rectified when selecting colors for the high-fidelity design.

## Prototype Design

We used these discoveries to develop a high-fidelity prototype for each theme. The fantasy-themed version features a knight for the user's character and uses humorous names for the different character stats. It also features fantasy-themed icons and a wizard character for the menu button. The standard fitness theme uses a character with fitness attire and standard names for the various stats. It also uses standard icons and a typical hamburger icon for the menu.

## User Testing

We then used these prototypes to conduct usability testing for two different task flows. The first flow required users to create an account and then log a new workout. The second required users to log in to an existing account, read an article, and then take a quiz on the article. 

We conducted this testing using the Maze platform via its Figma plugin. Participants completed each flow for the fantasy version followed by the fitness version, and then ranked their perception of the difficulty of the task on a Likert scale. At the end of the test, participants were asked to choose their preferred theme. In addition to this feedback, the Maze platform also provided analytics on user misclicks, a user click heatmap, and the time participants took to complete each task flow.

## Results

Of the 10 participants surveyed, they were found to have an equal preference for both themes. On average, participants found the tasks more difficult on the fantasy-themed version, and also were more likely to misclick and take longer to complete the task.

## Takeaways, Limitations and Future Work

This project was an invaluable experience in learning about user testing and Figma prototyping. It helped everyone on the team improve their skills in wireframing, prototyping, survey and test design, and data interpretation and analysis.

We gained valuable information about our designs, but the validity of our results was somewhat impacted by the structure of the free plan offered by Maze as well as our sample size. Participants were always shown the fantasy version first, followed by the fitness theme. This means that the results of the test were likely impacted by a learning bias, where users learned how to use the app during the test on the fantasy version and were able to complete the tasks more quickly and with fewer misclicks during the test on the fitness version.

If this work were to be continued in the future, the fantasy-themed version of the app should be modified to improve the legibility of the icons. Additionally, the clickable area of interactive components in both versions should be made larger to reduce misclicks and improve accessibility.
