# 3D Virtual Michelangelo Museum

## Summary

In this project, I collaborated with two other students to create a virtual art gallery that showcases a selection of Michelangelo's statues and paintings. I primarily contributed to the academic research, 3D design, and 3D programming aspects of the project.

## Project Scope

The goal of this project was to create a virtual gallery or museum devoted to a topic of our choosing. The gallery was required to have a 2D standard website as well as a 3D virtual space that could be explored in some way. We were allowed to choose from a variety of methods to create this gallery, and my team decided to create a custom website instead of using a pre-made solution for added flexibility.

## Research Phase

The project began with an intitial research phase where we brainstormed several potential topics before narrowing our ideas down. We decided that Michelangelo's works would be appropriate for the project, because he is well-known and also created art in a variety of mediums.

## Design

We created an initial wireframe design to explore a number possible layouts for the 2D portions of the website. The website features a homepage, a timeline of the selected artworks, and a table of the external assets that were used in creating the website.

Once the site structure and the general layout of the 2D portions of the website were decided upon, we created a higher-fidelity prototype to explore possible fonts, colors, and images for the website.

## Content Creation

Content for the website was created from a wide variety of sources. The text for the website and each artwork were written collaboratively based on academic sources. Images for the paintings were primarily found via WikiMedia and other public domain or creative commons sources.

The 3D assets were the most challenging to implement. The majority of the statues in the gallery were sourced from high-quality 3D scans of museum artworks that were uploaded to several 3D-printing-focused websites. These models were mostly untextured and unoptimized for web rendering. I was unfamiliar with the 3D modelling software Blender at the time, but I leveraged existing 3D modelling skills I had from my engineering degree to learn how to texture and optimize the models using Blender.

## Programming

The majority of the 2D portions of the website were programmed by my teammates, while I programmed the 3D environment and artwork information popups.
