# Michelangelo 3D Art Gallery

## Summary

In this project, I collaborated with two other students to create a virtual art gallery that showcases a selection of Michelangelo's statues and paintings. I was the primary programmer and designer of the 3D portions of the website, and I also contributed to the 2D design, research, and website content curation.

## Project Scope

The aim of this project was to create a virtual gallery or museum devoted to a topic of our choosing. We were required to create both a 2D standard website and a 3D virtual space that could be explored by users. We were allowed to choose from a variety of methods to create this gallery, and my team decided to create a custom website instead of using a pre-made solution for added flexibility.

## Research Phase

The project began with an initial research phase where we brainstormed several potential topics before narrowing our ideas down. We decided that Michelangeloâ€™s paintings and statues would be appropriate for the project because they are easily recognizable and they span 2D and 3D mediums. We then collected academic sources with relevant information about Michelangelo and his works for later content synthesis and selected an assortment of his most impactful work.

## Design

We created an initial wireframe design to explore possible layouts for the 2D portions of the website. We settled on a design that features a homepage, a timeline of the selected artworks, and a table of the external assets that were used in creating the website.

Once the site structure and the general layout were decided upon, we created a higher-fidelity prototype to explore possible fonts, colors, and images for the website. We decided that neutral colors and fonts would complement the artwork without distracting from the content.

## Content Creation

We used a wide variety of sources in creating content for the website. The website text and artwork descriptions were written collaboratively based on the academic sources we collected previously. Images of Michelangelo's paintings were primarily sourced via Wikimedia and other public domain or Creative Commons sources. 

The 3D assets were the most challenging to implement. We sourced the statues in the gallery from high-quality 3D scans of museum artworks from several 3D-printing-focused websites. These models were mostly untextured and unoptimized for web rendering. I was unfamiliar with the 3D modeling software Blender at the time, but I was able to leverage the existing 3D modeling skills I had from my engineering degree to learn how to texture and optimize the models using Blender.

## Programming

The majority of the 2D portions of the website were programmed by my teammates, while I programmed the 3D environment and artwork information popups. The 2D portions of the website and the gallery popups were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the 3D gallery was created using Three.js and TypeScript. Three.js is a JavaScript library devoted to 3D rendering, and TypeScript is a variation of JavaScript with additional features. We used GitHub to track our project and perform version management.

## Results

The finished product allows users to explore the 3D gallery and view Michelangelo's works to scale. The gallery includes paintings like the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and the Creation of Adam, and statues such as David and the Madonna of Burges. Users can also learn about the project and the various artworks through the traditional 2D website homepage and timeline, and they can find the original sources of the website assets on the resources page.

## Takeaways and Future Work

This project was an invaluable learning experience for everyone on the team. My teammates and I expanded our skills with HTML and CSS, and it was a game-changing experience for my understanding of JavaScript and 3D applications. If given the opportunity to further this project, I feel that the UX of the website could be improved by polishing the user interface to make the design more consistent and optimizing the 3D environment for computers with limited graphical hardware capabilities.
