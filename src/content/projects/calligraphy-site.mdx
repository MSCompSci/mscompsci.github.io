# Calligraphy Store Website

## Summary
In this project, I collaborated with two other students to design an e-commerce website for a fictitious small calligraphy business. We created a set of wireframes and a mid-fidelity prototype for another team of students who acted as our stakeholders.

## Project Scope
The goal of this project was to design a website that would meet the needs of a fictitious business developed by another team of students. The other team was responsible for creating a business idea and communicating their needs and preferences for the website. We were then responsible for creating a suitable website information architecture plan, website wireframe, and mid-fidelity prototype for their approval.
