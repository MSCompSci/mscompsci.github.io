# Calligraphy Store Website

## Summary
In this project, I collaborated with two other students to design an e-commerce website for a fictitious small calligraphy business called Calligraphy Rehab. We acted as design consultants and another team of students acted as our stakeholders. We performed some basic marketing research and then created a set of wireframes and a prototype to meet their requirements.

## Project Scope
The aim of this project was to design a website that would achieve the goals of a fictitious business developed by another team of students. The other team was responsible for creating a business idea and communicating their needs and preferences for the website. We were then responsible for assessing these requirements and creating a suitable website specification document with an information architecture plan and website wireframe for their approval. We then were responsible for applying stakeholder feedback to create a higher-fidelity prototype.

## Stakeholder Requirements

Our stakeholders provided us with a few initial ideas for the website, such as wanting to use a botanical-inspired theme that makes use of handwritten or calligraphy-inspired fonts. Additionally, they provided us with a target demographic of middle-aged adults and a desired set of content, such as an About section with a mission statement and company history, a contact section with a form, and a shop section with products on display.

## Research Phase

To support our design, we first performed some initial research to better determine the target audience of the design and the best terms for SEO. We investigated popular calligraphy Google search terms for the upstate NY area and found that terms such as journals, calligraphy, and custom pens were popular, particularly in areas with a high concentration of academic professionals. We compiled these findings into a list of SEO terms and an example user persona.

## Wireframe Design

A wireframe design was created based on this research. The home page features a navigation bar with links to the major sections of the website and a header with featured sale products and a call-to-action to increase sales. This is followed by a main company information section that links to the About page, as well as a carousel of featured products. Finally, the homepage contains a prominent contact section and a footer with helpful navigation links.
The products page features a list of products in several categories based on the popular search terms we discovered in the research phase. There is also the option for the user to search for a specific product, or filter products by price, sale status, category, or the ability to customize them.
The About page contains a history of the company and its mission statement, as well as prominent imagery to personalize the brand. At this stage of the project, the contact form page was not required to be designed, as the wireframe was primarily intended to be a sample design.

## Website Specification and Stakeholder Feedback

We compiled our findings into a website specification document, along with an estimated budget and project timeline. Additionally, the document contained the finalized wireframe, proposed site map, and a proposed technical implementation plan for the website. The document received a positive response from our stakeholders with only a minor critique of the website footer design.

## Prototype Design

The higher-fidelity design took this feedback into account, and the footer design was simplified. A variety of color schemes were explored, but a green and brown theme was selected to match the botanical-inspired theming requested by the stakeholders. 

The design was created with the intent of being aesthetically pleasing while also maintaining high readability for middle-aged and older adults who may encounter accessibility barriers with low-contrast themes or small text. A serif font was chosen for the page text to match the calligraphy-inspired theme while maintaining readability, and higher contrast colors and larger text were used when possible.

This stage of the design expanded on the earlier wireframe by adding a contact page and by polishing existing content on the home and about pages. The contact page features an image of the storefront with relevant contact information, as well as a contact form and Google Maps interactive element. The About page was expanded to include additional information about the sales team and images of the owners to further add to the personality of the company brand.

## Results

The project resulted in a mid-fidelity prototype of the website that successfully met stakeholder requirements. The website allows users to browse calligraphy products, learn more about the company, and contact the company with questions or concerns. 

## Takeaways and Future Work

This project greatly improved the Figma skills of everyone on the team and it allowed us to explore the connections between SEO, marketing, and successful web design. It also provided practice for communicating with stakeholders and drafting outlines of project specifications.
If this project were to be continued in the future, I would appreciate the opportunity to further polish the design of the product browsing page by improving the layout of the add-to-cart buttons on each product and by making the product images more prominent.
