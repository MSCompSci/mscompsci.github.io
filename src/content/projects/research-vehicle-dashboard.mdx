# A Real-Time Mobile Atmospheric Research Vehicle Dashboard Website

## Summary

This is a project I completed as part of a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program in 2020. I created a real-time dashboard to allow scientists affiliated with NASA, TOLNet, and the University of Alabama Huntsville to view the status of LIDAR equipment aboard a mobile atmospheric research vehicle. I also created a command line interface to allow these scientists to control the LIDAR cooling system and query information about its status from a linked computer system.
